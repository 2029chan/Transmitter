# Transmitter
This project focuses on building a UART module capable of serial communication at a baud rate of 115200. It enables reliable data transmission between devices over the UART protocol, with a customizable baud rate set to 115200 by default.
Key Features:
   Supports full-duplex communication.
   Fully configurable UART baud rate, defaulted to 115200.
   Efficient handling of start, stop, and parity bits in data transmission.
Usage:
   Navigate to the UART project directory.
   Synthesize the Verilog code and program your FPGA or microcontroller.
   Connect the device to a serial communication terminal and configure the baud rate to 115200 for communication.
